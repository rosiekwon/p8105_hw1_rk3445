## Problem 1

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

The `early_january_weather` dataset has 358 observations and 15
variables.

The variables include:

- `origin`: the origin of the observation
- `year`,`month`,`day`,`hour` : Time of recording.
- `temp`: temperature in Fahrenheit
- `dewp` : dewpoint in Fahrenheit
- `humidity`: humidity
- `wind_dir`,`wind_speed`,`wind_gust`: wind direction/speed/gust speed
- `precip`: precipitation
- `pressure`: pressure
- `visib`: visibility

The temperature (`temp`) ranges from 24.08 to 57.92 degrees Fahrenheit,
with a mean of 39.6.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + geom_point(aes(color = humid)) +labs(
    title = "Temperature in early January",
    x = "Day",
    y = "Temperature (°F)"
  )
```

The scatter plot shows the temperature trends in January. The
temperature increased steadily over two weeks, peaking around
mid-January above 55°F. As temperature increased, humidity also varied,
with spikes of high humidity during the warmest days. Early January
started cooler and drier, but by mid-January it became warmer and more
humid.

## Problem 2

Create a data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
df = 
  tibble(
    numeric_var = rnorm(10),
    logical_var = numeric_var > 0,
    char_var = letters[1:10],
    factor_var = factor(sample(c("Level1", "Level2", "Level3"), 10, replace = TRUE))
  )
```

**Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works
and what doesn’t?**

- Method 1)

``` r
sapply(df, mean)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA
    ## Warning in mean.default(X[[i]], ...): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## numeric_var logical_var    char_var  factor_var 
    ##  0.02418385  0.50000000          NA          NA

- Method 2) Hint: for now, to take the mean of a variable in a
  dataframe, you need to pull the variable out of the dataframe. Try
  loading the tidyverse and using the pull function.

``` r
num <- df %>% pull(numeric_var)
mean(num)
```

    ## [1] 0.02418385

``` r
logi <- df %>% pull(logical_var)
mean(logi)
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
char <- df %>% pull(char_var)
mean(char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(char): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
fac <- df %>% pull(factor_var)
mean(fac)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(fac): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Numeric vector can calculated mean. R treats TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0
for logical vector, so mean gives the proportion of TRUEs. However,
character vector is text so mean cannot be calculated. Factor vector is
categorical value so mean cannot be calculated as well.

**In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to
another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not
the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens
when you try to take the mean?**

``` r
num_char <- mean(as.numeric(char))
```

    ## Warning in mean(as.numeric(char)): NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
num_log <- mean(as.numeric(logi))
num_fac <- mean(as.numeric(fac))
```

For character variables, coercing them to numeric produces a warning
because non-numeric strings cannot be converted, resulting in NA values
and an invalid mean. Converting logical values into numeric values gives
the proportion of TRUE values. For factor variables, numeric conversion
returns the internal integer codes assigned to each level. However,
taking the mean of these integer codes is not related to actual mean of
the values. This helps me to explain why mean() function behaves
differently depending on the variable type and it only works directly on
numeric and logical vectors.
